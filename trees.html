         <a class="tit">Orange</a> plants and other citrus plants can make a beautiful houseplant for your home. They bring brilliant colour and scent to your home, with the flowers and fruit they produce. As long as the basic factors are met, caring for a citrus plant is relatively easily. Follow our top tips on how to care for an orange tree to produce a healthy plant with some healthy fruit. 
         good to grow as a houseplant because they thrive in the stable warmth that is provided indoors. Citrus plants grow best with temperatures at 18°C during the day, and between 5°C and 10°C at night. In summer, these houseplants can be moved outdoors once the risk of frost has passed. However, as soon as it becomes cold they need to be moved indoors. Also, some citrus plants are more fragile than others. For example, lemon trees can tolerate temperatures down to 5°C, whereas limes can only tolerate temperatures down to 10°C and Calamondin oranges only 13°C. Depending on the type of citrus plant, determine when or if you should move it outdoors in the summer, based on this information. </p>

            <a class="tit">Willows</a> a large tree with long, flowing branches and leaves, the willow tree often symbolizes flexibility and adaptability. The limber and supple nature of its extremities means it bends to accommodate and withstand strong winds and adverse weather. Many, therefore, see it as inspiring and symbolic of humans’ capability to withstand hardship, loss, and difficult emotions. Thanks to its long life and the ease with which new trees can be rooted from cuttings, the willow tree is also seen as a survivor and a symbol of rebirth.

            The willow tree originates from China, and in Ancient China, people believed that willow branches could ward off evil. They were often carried around or placed at doorways to keep evil spirits away. The concept of the willow tree bringing good luck and protecting against evil is also prevalent in countless cultures across the world.</p>

            <a class="tit">Forsythia</a>  plants are deciduous shrubs. In some species the yellow four-petaled flowers, borne along the stems, appear before the leaves in early spring. The simple narrow leaves occasionally have three parts and are borne oppositely along the pithy or hollow stems. The fruit is usually a capsule. Forsythia is used for swelling of small air passages in the lung (bronchiolitis), tonsillitis, sore throat, fever, vomiting, heart disease, HIV/AIDS, gonorrhea, pain and swelling (inflammation), and a severe skin rash with fever and vomiting caused by a bacterium (erysipelas).

            Sometimes forsythia is given intravenously (by IV) in combination with other herbs for treating bronchiolitis.</p>
