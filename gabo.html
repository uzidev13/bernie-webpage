    What if I told you that I've fallen?
    And I like the way you say my name
    My heart skips a beat when I hear you calling
    And I like that it won't go away
    
    But never mind, don't wanna give you any trouble
    Never mind, never mind
    I'm okay with being by your side for as long as I can hide
    What if I told you that I've fallen?
    
    What if I told you that I've fallen?
    The heart-shaped arrow through my chest
    I'll make your breakfast every morning
    And pick you up when you're a mess
    
    But I know that it won't ever stop
    You know I'll be there when you call me whether you like it or not
    Without a warning, now I'm falling for this picture on my phone
    But don't mind me, I'm just falling, I'll be back up on my own

Nevermind, nevermind, nevermind
What if I told you that I've fallen?
Nevermind, nevermind, nevermind
What if I told you that I've fallen?
Nevermind, nevermind, nevermind

What if I told you that I've fallen?
Nevermind
What if I told you that I've fallen?
Oh, nevermind
What if I told you that I've fallen?
Oh, nevermind
What if I told you that I've fallen?
Nevermind, I said nevermind
I shouldn't tell you that I've fallenWhat if I told you that I've fallen?
And I like the way you say my name
My heart skips a beat when I hear you calling
And I like that it won't go away

But never mind, don't wanna give you any trouble
Never mind, never mind
I'm okay with being by your side for as long as I can hide
What if I told you that I've fallen?

What if I told you that I've fallen?
The heart-shaped arrow through my chest
I'll make your breakfast every morning
And pick you up when you're a mess

But I know that it won't ever stop
You know I'll be there when you call me whether you like it or not
Without a warning, now I'm falling for this picture on my phone
But don't mind me, I'm just falling, I'll be back up on my own

Please don't say my name, help me put out this flame
I'd rather hold onto this feeling that you don't even believe in
What if I told you that I've fallen?
